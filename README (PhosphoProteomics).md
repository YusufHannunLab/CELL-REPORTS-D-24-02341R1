# PhosphoProteomics Analysis

The analysis pipeline used for Mojtaba Sadeghi's PKCa CRISPR phosphoproteomics experiment. This experiment is reported in a work entitled "Biased Signaling by Mutant EGFR Underlies Dependence on PKCa in Lung Adenocarcinoma," and forms an essential part of the corresponding manuscript.

This repository was created to facilitate review of the code used to analyze this specific experiment.

If you happen to get your hands on this code, either accidentally or with my express intent to share it with you, and use it to develop or inspire your own phosphoproteomics analysis pipeline, please, acknowledge us (Sam B. Chiappone and Yusuf A. Hannun) in any published work that arises from such an analysis pipeline. I worked hard on it. Thank you!! :)

Best,
Sam
